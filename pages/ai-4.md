# Harm and Benefit

The consequences of an action can be called its **"effects"**. We classify the effects of actions into two categories: harm and benefit.

::left::

## Harm

Harm is something that results in a negative effect for a person, or group of people.

Harm can include:

- Psychological harm (feeling anxious or depressed)
- Physical harm (being hurt or injured)
- Emotional harm (feeling sad or scared)
- Social harm (being excluded or bullied)
- Economic harm (losing money or resources)

::right::

## Benefit

Benefits are the positive effects that result from an action or decision.

Benefits can include:
- Psychological benefits (feeling happy or fulfilled)
- Physical benefits (improved health or fitness)
- Emotional benefits (feeling loved or supported)
- Social benefits (building relationships or community)
- Economic benefits (gaining wealth or resources)

# Harm and Benefit in AI

```mermaid

flowchart LR
A("A writer at a local newspaper uses AI to write an article to meet their deadline") ---> B("Effect: The writer is able to meet their deadline")
A ---> C("Effect: The article contains an error and misleads readers")

```

- The writer experiences a *benefit*
    - They meet their deadline
- The readers experience *harm*
    - They are misled by the error in the article

What other benefits and harms can you think of in this scenario?

# Stakeholders

You might have noticed that the people who experienced harm were not the same as those who experienced benefit. Anyone affected by an action is called a **stakeholder**. 

*A stakeholder is anyone who has an interest in or is affected by a decision or action.*

In our newspaper example:
- The *writer* is a stakeholder who benefits from meeting their deadline
- The *readers* are stakeholders who are harmed by the misleading article
- The *newspaper* is a stakeholder that:
    - benefits from the article being published
    - is harmed by the potential loss of trust from readers
