# Do Now

**Case Study:**

You have received an email from a person you don't know. The email has a file attached with the file name **"your-stuff.exe"**. The email says this is important information from the school and you should download it immediately.

1. What type of file is your-stuff.exe likely to be?
2. What should you do with the email and the file?

*Answer in your book (you don't have to write the question this time)*

# Computer Components

Computers are made up of multiple independent parts we call components. 
<img src="/img/components.jpg" alt="Computer Components" style="width: 150px; float: right" />
- These have different functions and processes.
- The price and performance of these components depends on the requirements of the user.
- We will look at most of these components in desktop computers, as they have the clearest separation (you can easily tell them apart)

# Motherboard

<img src="/img/motherboard.png" alt="Computer Components" style="width: 200px; float: right;" />

- Main circuit board within a computer.
- Connects all the different components together and allows them to communicate.

# CPU - Central Processing Unit

<img src="/img/CPU.png" alt="Computer Components" style="width: 200px; float: right; margin-left: 20px;" />

- Executes instructions of a computer program to perform calculations and processes.
- Attached to the motherboard, with a cooler attached

# RAM - Random Access Memory

<img src="/img/RAM.jpg" alt="Computer Components" style="width: 200px; float: right; margin-left: 20px;" />

- Stores data that the computer is actively working on.
- Programs that are running require RAM to temporarily hold information.
- Information that is stored in RAM is lost when the computer is turned off.
- *CANNOT be downloaded*

# Hard Drive and Solid State Drive (SSD)

<img src="/img/HDD.jpg" alt="Computer Components" style="width: 200px; float: right; margin-left: 20px;" />
<img src="/img/SSD.png" alt="Computer Components" style="width: 200px; float: right; clear:both; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 20px;" />

- Stores files and information on computers
- Hard drivess are slower but cheaper for the same amount of storage
    - They use spinning magnetic disks to store information
- SSDs are faster but more expensive
    - They use flash memory to store information

# Graphics Card

<img src="/img/graphics.png" alt="Computer Components" style="width: 200px; float: right; margin-left: 20px;" />

- Processes visual or graphical data
- Often required primarily for rendering and video games 
- Can be integrated into the motherboard or a separate card
- *NOT* required for most office work
- Includes outputs for monitors (HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA)

# Monitor

<img src="/img/monitor.png" style="width: 200px; float: right; margin-left: 20px;background-color: white;"/>

- Displays the output of the computer. 
- Desktops can use multiple monitors at once, with one being the primary monitor.
- Monitors can be different sizes and resolutions, with different refresh rates.
- Monitor size is measured diagonally in inches or cm.

# Power Supply

<img src="/img/psu.jpg" alt="Computer Components" style="width: 200px; float: right; margin-left: 20px;" />

- Converts electricity from the wall (AC) into a form that the computer can use (DC).
- Provides power to all the components in the computer.
- Measured in Watts, with more powerful computers requiring more power.

<img src="/img/case.jpg" alt="Computer Components" style="width: 200px; float: right; margin-left: 20px;" />

- Encloses all the components of the computer.
- Protects the components from dust and damage.
- Can be customised with different colours, shapes, and sizes.
- May include fans (or other methods) for cooling and lights for aesthetics.

# Your Task

- On the worksheet, identify the different components of a computer and describe their purpose/function.
- I will flick through the slides if you need them, but try your best to remember from the discussion (and from the computer in front of you)
