# Servers

- A server is a computer or system that exists to serve other computers.
- They could provide data, services, or resources (like printers) to other computers.
- Servers are often more powerful than regular computers and have more storage.
- Large tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have thousands of servers, found in large data centres around the world.

# Research Activity

In a moment you will be completing a research activity, using the Internet to search. 

Some handy reminders for research:

- Try to use more than one source.
- Try to use your own words to summarise what you read, rather than copying word for word
- Check that the information you find actually answers the questions

# Server Types

Today we are doing a research activity to discover information about the different types of servers.

You will be working in <span v-mark>randomly selected</span> small groups to research a different type of server, using your laptop and the internet.

I will put you into groups and give you a type of server to research.

::left::

- Web Server
- File Server
- Print Server
- Mail Server
- Database Server
- Game Server

::right::

You need to investigate the following questions:
1. What does this type of server do?
2. What are some examples of when you might use this type of server?
3. Find some companies that would use this type of server.
4. Anything more you can find out in the time we have.

<span v-mark.highlight.purple>Each group will have a chance to present back on what they found out</span>
