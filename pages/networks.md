# What is a Network?

A network is a group of two or more computers that are connected together to share resources and information.

- Your home internet connection is a small network.
- The school network is a larger network. 

These are both examples of Local Area Networks (LANs), because they are limited to a local (small) area.

- The Internet is a global network of networks.
- The Internet is a Wide Area Network (WAN), because it covers a wide area.

# Why do we use Networks?

- To share resources (e.g. printers, files, internet connection)
- To communicate with each other (e.g. email, chat)
- To access information (e.g. websites, databases)
- To play games with each other (e.g. online gaming)
- To work together on projects (e.g. Google Docs, Microsoft Teams)

# Switches and Routers
- A switch is a device that connects devices on a network and allows them to communicate with each other.
- A router is a device that connects different networks together and allows them to communicate with each other.
- A router is also used to connect a network to the Internet.

Your home network is likely to include a router but may not include a switch.

# Wireless and Wired Networks

- A wired network uses cables to connect devices together.
- A wireless network uses radio waves to connect devices together.
- Wireless networks are more convenient, but wired networks are usually faster and more reliable.
- Wireless networks are more vulnerable to security threats, so data is usually encrypted.

# Clients and Servers

- A client is a device that requests data or services from a server.
    - Your computer, tablet or phone is usually acting as a client.
- A server is a device that provides data or services to clients.
    - A web server provides web pages to your browser.
    - A file server provides files to your computer.
    - We discovered information about servers in the last lesson.

# Your Turn

1. Complete the worksheet by connecting the terms to the corresponding images and their definitions.
    - You can work with a partner, but you must write your own answers.

2. (If time) A small business wants to set up a network. They have 4 computers, 2 printers, and 1 internet connection. Three of the computers are in one room, and the other computer is in a different room (the manager's office). 
    - Draw a diagram of how you would set up the network, including any switches or routers that you would use.
    - Research the cost of the equipment you would need and calculate the total cost.
