# Do Now - Think, Pair, Share

Which survey question would be the best way to identify what people know about password security? (and why do you think that?)

1. What is a password? *(Text box for answer)*
2. How often do you use a password manager? *(Never, Sometimes, Most of the time, Always)*
3. Which of the following is the strongest password? *('12345678', 'password', 'M3liss@!', 'Turtle5-R-Funn7')*
4. When was the last time you changed your password? *(This week, This month, This year, I don't remember)*

# Mr Matheson's thoughts

Which survey question would be the best way to identify what people know about password security? (and why do you think that?)

<v-clicks depth="2" >

1. What is a password? *(Text box for answer)*
    - This is a good question, but it is a little bit simple. Also - the answers people give will be difficult to analyse as part of a survey.
2. How often do you use a password manager? *(Never, Sometimes, Most of the time, Always)*
    - This question asks about what they **do**, rather than what they **know**. 
3. Which of the following is the strongest password? *('12345678', 'password', 'M3liss@!', 'Turtle5-R-Funn7')*
    - This is probably the best question. It asks about what they know, and the answers are easy to analyse. (The best answer is 'Turtle5-R-Funn7' - it is long, has upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. M3liss@! is also a good answer, but Melissa might be their name or the name of someone close to them so it is not as strong.)
4. When was the last time you changed your password? *(This week, This month, This year, I don't remember)*
    - This is a good question, but it also asks about what they do, rather than what they know.

# First: Feedback for Mr Matheson

- The top of the lesson plan has a link to a survey
- It looks like the survey on the right hand side
- This is very quick, but it helps me if you are as honest as possible
- I will use the feedback to improve my lessons
- Answers are anonymous, but be sensible with the comments at the end

# Grandma at the Basketball

You are a basketball player and Grandma is your biggest fan. She is always at the games, cheering you on. After hearing you are learning Microsoft Excel, Grandma has been tracking your scores in a spreadsheet, and she now has 6 games worth of data. 

She wants to know:

- How many points you scored in each game
- How many points you scored in total
- What your average points per game is

She also wants a graph that tracks your points over time.

# The Task

1. Open Microsoft Excel and create a new spreadsheet
2. Create your table to look like this:

| Game	| 1 pointers	| 2 pointers	| 3 Pointers | Total |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 1	| 0	| 4	| 0 |   |
| 2	| 3	| 2	| 2 |   |
| 3	| 4	| 4	| 1 |   |
| 4	| 1	| 3	| 3 |   |
| 5	| 2	| 2	| 2 |   |
| 6	| 0	| 7	| 0 |   |
| Total	|   |   |   |   |
| Average	|   |   |   |   |

::right::

3. Calculate the total points scored for each game, **using a formula**. The total scored is:
    - 1 point for each 1 pointer
    - 2 points for each 2 pointer
    - 3 points for each 3 pointer
<img src="/img/grandma-cheer2.webp" alt="Grandma cheering" style="width:200px; float:right" />
4. Calculate the total points scored for all games, **using a formula**. This should use the `SUM` function we learned about last week.

5. Calculate the average points scored per game, **using a formula**. This should be use the `AVERAGE` function.

6. Create a line graph of points over time. The x-axis should be the game number, and the y-axis should be the total points scored.

# What are some ways we people might get your private information?

<v-clicks depth="2">

1. **Phishing**: People might send you fake emails or messages that look real, asking for your personal information.
2. **Social Engineering**: Someone might try to trick you into giving them your information by pretending to be someone you trust.
3. **Data Breaches**: Sometimes, companies that store your information can be hacked, and your data is stolen.
4. **Public Wi-Fi**: Using public Wi-Fi can expose your information to hackers if you are not careful.
5. **Your Own Actions**: Sometimes, we might share too much information on social media or other platforms without thinking about the consequences.

# How can you protect your private information?

<v-clicks depth="2">

1. **Use Strong Passwords**: Create complex passwords that are hard to guess and change them regularly. Don't use the same password for multiple accounts.
2. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**: This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification.
3. **Be Cautious with Personal Information**: Think before sharing personal details online, especially on social media.
4. **Check Privacy Settings**: Regularly review and adjust the privacy settings on your social media accounts and other online services. If apps need access to location or contacts, consider if it is necessary.
