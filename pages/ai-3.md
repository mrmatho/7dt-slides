# ChatGPT


<img src="/img/generative-ai-text.png" alt="ChatGPT Logo" style="width:250px; float:right;"/>


ChatGPT is a generative AI model developed by OpenAI that can understand and generate human-like text. It can answer questions, write essays, create stories, and even engage in conversations. It uses a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to process and generate text based on the input it receives.

*Demo*

# Generating Text

LLM's (like ChatGPT) break up text into tiny chunks called tokens.  For example the sentence "Mr Matheson is very smart and teaches Year 7 students." would be broken up into the following tokens:

```json
[
  "Mr",
  " Matheson",
  " is",
  " very",
  " smart",
  " and",
  " teaches",
  " Year",
  " 7",
  " students",
  "."
]
```

# Generating Text

The *algorithm* behind an *LLM* learns how tokens in the dataset relate to each other. It then uses this knowledge to predict the next token in a sequence. For example if the input is "Mr Matheson is very", the model might predict the next token to be "smart" based on its training data.

|Prompt| Possible Next Tokens| Probability |
|---|---|---|
|Mr Matheson is very| smart, old, funny, strict| 40%, 20%, 30%, 10% |
|The capital of France is| Paris, London, Berlin, Madrid | 90%, 5%, 3%, 2% |

This process repeats until the model has generated a complete response or reaches a specified length.

# Plagiarism, Copyright and Deep Fakes

- **Plagiarism**: Using AI-generated content without proper attribution can lead to plagiarism issues, especially in schools, TAF and universities. If you present work generated by AI as your own, it doesn't show what you actually know or can do.
- **Copyright**: Artificial intelligence needs massive amounts of data to learn from, and this data often includes copyrighted material. The people who originally created the data often have not given permission or been paid for their work that the AI is using and profiting from.
- **Deep Fakes**: AI can create realistic fake images, videos, and audio that can be used to mislead or manipulate people. This can lead to misinformation, privacy violations, and even identity theft.

# Hallucinations

When a person sees something that isn't real, we call it a "hallucination". When an AI model generates information that is incorrect or made up, we also call this a "hallucination".

*LLMs* can generate text that sounds plausible but is actually false or misleading. Because the model is just predicting what the next word should be, it can get it completely wrong. The LLM also can present this information in a way that doesn't let you know that it has guessed. This can lead to the spread of misinformation and confusion.

# Bias in AI

- AI models can only create content based on the data they were trained on.
- Most AI models use data from the internet, which can contain biases and stereotypes.
- If the training data is biased, the AI will also be biased.
- This can lead to unfair or harmful content being generated, reinforcing existing stereotypes and discrimination.

*Summarise why AI might be biased towards certain groups of people in your booklet.*
