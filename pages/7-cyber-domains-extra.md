# Understanding a Web Address

- A web address (URL) is how you find websites on the internet.  
- It tells your browser where to go. When you hover over a link, you can see the web address it points to.
- Understanding web addresses helps you stay safe online and makes it less likely you will fall for scams.

# Parts of a Web Address

## Web address structure
A typical web address looks like this:  
`https://www.example.com/page`

- `https`: *Protocol* (how data is sent)
- `www.example.com`: *Domain name* (website name)
- `/page`: *Path* (specific page)

We don't really need to worry too much about the Path part. More important is understanding the *Protocol* and *Domain Name*.

### Protocol: HTTPS?

- HTTPS means "HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure"
- It encrypts data between your browser and the website (sends it in a secret code)
- This helps protect your information from *hackers*
- It is safer than HTTP.

# Domain Name?
- The *domain name* is the address of the server where the website is hosted.
- Each domain name is unique - owned by a person or organization.
- The end of a domain name is called the top-level domain (TLD), like `.com`, `.org`, or `.edu`.
- The TLD might also have a country code, like `.au` for Australia or `.sg` for Singapore.
- Some TLDs are more trustworthy than others, especially in Australia:
    - `.gov.au` is only for Australian government sites
    - `.edu.au` is only for educational institutions
    - `.org.au` is only for non-profit organizations
- Other TLDs (like `.com`, `.net`, and many others) **can be used by anyone**, so they are less trustworthy.

# Domains and Subdomains

- In a web address, the domain name is the main part.
- A subdomain is a part of the domain, like **`blog`**`.example.com`.
- Only the `example.com` part is the main domain.
- The `blog` part is a subdomain, which could be just about anything
- Scammers use subdomains to trick you into thinking a site is real.

# Common Scammer TLDs

::left::

According to research, these TLDs are the ones most commonly used by scammers:
- .com 
- .cn 
- .tk 
- .ml 
- .xyz 
- .buzz 
- .shop 
- .cf 
- .net 
- .ga 

::right::

- These TLDs are often used by scammers because they are often either cheap or free to register.
- Just because a website uses one of these TLDs doesn't make it a scam, but you should be careful.
- .com is mostly there because it is also the most common TLD on the internet, so it is used by many real sites.
