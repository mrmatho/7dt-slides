# Password Managers

- Store and manage passwords securely
- Generate strong, unique passwords
- Autofill login forms
- Examples: LastPass, 1Password, Bitwarden, Built-in browser password managers
- Risks: 
    - If someone hacks your password manager, they can access all your passwords
    - If you forget your password manager password, you lose access to all your passwords
    - You have to be able to access your password manager whenever you need to login to anything

# Password Management

- **The easiest way for someone to guess your password is for you to tell them:**
    - Don't share passwords even with friends you trust
    - Passwords that are written down are the best way for someone to find out your password
    - A laptop that is stolen is hard to login to, but a laptop with a password written on a sticky note is easy to login to
- **Any time you get notified of a breach: change your password immediately**
- **Password managers can help, but they also have risks:**
    - If you forget your password manager password, you lose access to all your passwords
    - If someone hacks your password manager, they can access all your passwords
- **Key systems like email and banking are the most important to protect:**
    - Password resets are usually sent to your email
    - Bank accounts have access to your $
