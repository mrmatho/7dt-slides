# Learner Agency Framework

## Learner Agency Elements

In Digital Technology this year, your progress will be tracked against 4 elements of learner agency:

- **being a producer**
- **being persistent**
- **being open to the new** and 
- **being reflective**. 

Each of these ideas can be confronting at times, and nobody will do all of these perfectly all the time. Instead, we are looking for you to grow over the course of the semester. 

These elements are being assessed across all of Year 7-9 for progress reports, and similar elements are being used in the senior school. For you to perform well in Digital Technology this semester, it is important that you know what we are looking for in each of these areas.
