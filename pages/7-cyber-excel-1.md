# Spreadsheets

Spreadsheets are a powerful tool for managing and analyzing data. They allow you to perform calculations, create charts, and organize information in a structured way.

The most popular spreadsheet software is Microsoft Excel, but there are other options including Google Sheets and LibreOffice Calc.

# Spreadsheet Basics

A spreadsheet is made up of rows and columns. Each cell in the spreadsheet can contain text, numbers, or formulas.

The boxes that make up the spreadsheet are called cells. Each cell has a unique address, which is made up of the column letter and the row number. For example, the cell in the first column and first row is called A1.

# Today's Story

## Pocket Money (Or how my daughter convinced me to give her more pocket money)

My daughter Claire is starting high school this year too, and we decided that this was a good time for her to start paying for more things. Specifically, we wanted her to:

- buy any canteen food she wanted
- buy her own clothes (other than school uniform)
- pay for birthday and christmas presents for her friends and family

We decided that we would give her $10 a week, and she could spend it however she wanted. We also told her that if she wanted to buy something that cost more than $10, she would have to save up for it. She decided that wasn't enough, and she wanted to convince us to give her more.

# How she did it

1. She created a spreadsheet with a list of all the clothes, shoes and presents she would need to buy under the new rules and estimated how much each item would cost.
2. She used a multiplication formula to calculate the total cost of all the items.
3. She then used the spreadsheet to calculate how much money this would cost her each week on average. Her spreadsheet looked like this:

|Item|Cost|Number per year|Total Cost|
|---|---|---|---|
|Shoes|$100|1|$100|
|T-Shirts|$25|5|$100|
|---|---|---|---|
| | | **Total**| **$1500** |
| | | **Weekly**| **$30** |

**Your task is to create a similar spreadsheet. Choose the items you think you would need to buy in a year and estimate the prices. Let's get cashed up!**
