# What makes a good survey question?

- Questions should be **clear** and **easy to understand**
- Questions should be **specific**
- Questions should be **relevant** to your topic
- It is a good idea to include at least once scenario-based question e.g. "If you received a text message from your bank asking you to click a link, what would you do?"

<br />

# What makes a question easy to analyse?

- Questions that use multiple choice answers, yes/no answers, or rating scales (1-5) are easier to analyse than textbox questions
- Knowledge questions with one correct answer
- Behaviour questions that ask about frequency (e.g. "How often do you...") or likelihood (e.g. "How likely are you to...")

# The Consent Statement

A consent statement is a message that tells people what they are agreeing to when they fill out your survey. For this survey, we have prepared a consent statement for you to use. You can copy and paste it from the lesson plan into your Google Form.

"This survey is voluntarily collecting anonymous data from friends and families of Year 7 Digital Technology students on the cyber security topic of ______. The information collected will only be used for purposes of investigating the knowledge and practices of our community and will not be gathering personal or private data. The responses will be analysed using Excel and graphs produced to provide a summary of our findings. 

If you are happy to complete this survey, please continue."
