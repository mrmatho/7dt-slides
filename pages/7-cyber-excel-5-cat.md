# What makes a good survey question?

- Questions should be **clear** and **easy to understand**
- Questions should be **specific**
- Questions should be **relevant** to your topic
- It is a good idea to include at least once scenario-based question e.g. "If you received a text message from your bank asking you to click a link, what would you do?"

<br />

# What makes a question easy to analyse?

- Questions that use multiple choice answers, yes/no answers, or rating scales (1-5) are easier to analyse than textbox questions
- Knowledge questions with one correct answer
- Behaviour questions that ask about frequency (e.g. "How often do you...") or likelihood (e.g. "How likely are you to...")
