# What do you need to do?

1. Select a problem you want to solve
2. Design the solution (including using a flowchart)

# Choosing a Problem to Solve

Your problem needs to have: 

- A clear goal
- Input and output
- Use of multiple micro:bit features (eg. sensors, buttons, LEDs, radio, etc.)

You can choose a problem from the provided list or choose your own. The more original ideas will be more interesting to work on!

Your problem can (but doesn't have to) use more that one micro:bit if you would like, and they can be running the same or different code from one another.

# Project Example Ideas

- A simple game (e.g. rock-paper-scissors, a quiz, etc.)
- A weather station that displays temperature from another micro:bit
